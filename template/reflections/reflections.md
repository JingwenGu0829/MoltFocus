  - Deadline paper: literature review 2h
  - Important project: fix CI pipeline 90m

- **Notes**
  - Wanted to start experiments but lit review took longer than expected — worth it though, found two papers that change the framing.
- **Reflection**
  Good deep work in the morning. Afternoon was choppy after class but recovered for the evening block. CI fix was satisfying — turned out to be a permissions issue.
- **Auto-summary**
  - [Good] 2026-02-08: done 3/4 items. Lit review ran over but productive. CI fix closed. Protect morning block for experiments tomorrow.

  - Deadline paper: skipped — energy was low after a rough night of sleep.

  Honest day. Got the API refactor done which was the hardest thing on the list. Should have napped instead of pushing through the afternoon. Tomorrow I need to prioritize the paper.

## 2026-02-06
- Time: 2026-02-06T21:15
- **Rating:** GOOD
- **Mode:** RECOVERY
- **Done**
  - Deadline paper: outline + intro draft 2.5h
  - Important project: code review 60m
- **Notes**
  - Recovery mode today — was behind from the weekend. Focused on the two most important things only.
- **Reflection**
  Recovery mode helped. Didn't feel guilty about skipping maintenance. The paper intro came together faster than expected once I just started writing. Code review surfaced a subtle race condition — good catch.
- **Auto-summary**
  - [Good] 2026-02-06: recovery day, done 2/3. Paper intro drafted, race condition found in review. Momentum is back.
